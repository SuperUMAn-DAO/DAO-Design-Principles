## SuperUMAn DAO - Mission, Goals, & Values

## Mission Statement 

**The core mission of the SuperUMAns is to communicate the true power of universal access to markets and its benefits to the world.** 

## Vision

“Attaining universal access to markets is almost like learning a language. And it's up to us to figure out how to say beautiful things with it.”

Creating universal access to markets faces this challenge today: we are enabling a type of economic relationship for which there is not yet sufficient non-technical infrastructure. As the engineers work to improve the effectiveness of the tools, it is the **purpose of the DAO to build the knowledge, skills and culture to facilitate trustless financial instruments.** 

To fully maximise human potential, the language of trustless financial instruments needs to be spoken more widely. We seek to be the human interface who can unlock the potential of universal access to markets by acting as translators, interpreters and teachers". 

## Goals 

- **(Education)** Be a platform that spreads awareness & knowledge of Instruments that make markets more accessible to all.

- **(Community)** Be an inclusive, fun and lighthearted DAO that is always growing. We embrace learning while sharing our knowledge and experiences.

- **(Cultural)** Embody a culture that embraces people from any background and skillset who are enthusiastic about our mission and values. 

- **(Inclusivity)** Celebrate that everyone has value to add, and that with encouragement and support can explore, find and harness their superpowers.

- **(Financial)** Recognise the value that we provide and responsibly steward resources.

- **(Growth)** Leverage our experiences to educate and facilitate universal access to markets.

- **(Deliver)** Be a testbed for financial instruments both existing and homegrown to strengthen and support various elements of the ecosystem. 

## Values

We aim to create a welcoming and inclusive culture that is open to anyone who shares the same enthusiasm for universal access to markets. The SuperUMAn DAO strives for the success of the community and also the improved wellbeing of each individual. We encourage people from all backgrounds and with all skill sets to join us to nurture their talent.  

Through nurturing talent and caring about each other's aims and ambitions, we embody a core fundamental belief that we can effect systemic global change together. Bringing value is not predicated on any technical knowledge or predefined skill set, but intention and enthusiasm.   We believe that everyone has value to add to our mission, but needs an encouraging and supportive outlet to explore their superpowers.

- **Growth and Learning:** We are no strangers to imposter syndrome. We encourage each other to imagine for a moment that perhaps you really are the best person for a job and to explore things that might have felt out of reach.

- **Community Focused:** What brings us together is not just the opportunity to earn for ourselves, but to join something bigger than ourselves. We celebrate individual successes as a win for the DAO, and each individual takes pride in community achievements.

- **Onwards and Upwards:** We are here to make friends and build supportive relationships for the long run, through a persistent and positive attitude. We focus on solutions and recognise that the path is forged by walking.  

- **Creating Cool Shit:** We are participating in a revolution that affects every domain of our lives and building the future of human coordination.
