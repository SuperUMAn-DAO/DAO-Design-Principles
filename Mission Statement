## Mission Statement 

The core mission of the SuperUMAns is to communicate the true power of universal access to markets and its benefits to the world. 

## Vision

“Attaining universal access to markets is almost like learning a language. And it's up to us to figure out how to say beautiful things with it.”

Creating universal access to markets faces this challenge today: we are enabling a type of economic relationship for which there is not yet sufficient non-technical infrastructure. As the engineers work to improve the effectiveness of the tools, **it is the purpose of the DAO to build the knowledge, skills and culture to facilitate trustless financial instruments**. 

To fully maximise human potential, the language of trustless financial instruments needs to be spoken more widely. We seek to be the human interface who can unlock the potential of universal access to markets by acting as translators, interpreters and teachers".
