## Membership of the SuperUMAn DAO

## Preamble
Membership of the SuperUMAn DAO comprises 3 tiers of membership which have differential voting rights, depending on membership level. All members of the DAO are entitled to voting rights for DAO proposals, compensation for their contribution and access to higher levels of membership, with all the rights they bring.

## Initial Membership and membership tiers
The founding members of the SuperUMAn DAO will be comprised of: 
- Those who currently hold the UMAster, SuperUMAn and Recruit tags on discord at the 31st December 2021. 
- Specific others who are identified as those whose influence would add value to the DAO, such as those who hold the Honorary DAOplomats tag. 

It is recognised that while all of the above groups have a stake in the development and wellbeing of the DAO, some of the above are more closely aligned with its mission, and have a greater stake in the DAO’s growth than others, consequently it is suggested that there is a three tier system in place to allow the level of influence in the DAO to reflect those differential stakes. 

Tier membership will confer differential voting rights through a multiplier effect.

The proposed tiers are 
- Basic (Recruits + Honorary DAOplomats + Alumni): one member, one vote
- SuperUMAns - enhanced: one member, 10 votes
- UMAsters - enhanced plus: one member 20 votes

These voting parameters can be modified by governance.

Members of the DAO will be identified by an NFT tied to a wallet address that they provide. That NFT and wallet will be used both as a means of voting in the governance process, and also as the wallet identifier of any compensation due to them as DAO members.

## Joining the DAO
Once the DAO is initially established the process for joining the DAO is as follows but may be changed or amended by governance. 

Once a potential member expresses interest, they are directed to fill in an application to alert the onboarding team, who will complete the initial onboarding process with them, this would include.

- A commitment to the mission, goals and values of the DAO
- Completion of a short introductory course to the SuperUMAn DAO
- Team selection
- Completion of a short task(s) as assigned by the chosen team lead.

On completion of the above, an NFT will be provided to the wallet address that they provide to indicate their Recruit status.

## Becoming SuperUMAn
There will be a clearly defined process for a recruit to move to the SuperUMAn role as defined by the governance process. This may include
- Completion of educational courses
- Engagement with an allocated mentor from their chosen team
- Evidence of active participation in the DAO 
- An example of a concrete initiative 
- Sponsorship by an existing SuperUMAn who can vouch for their activity.

The promotions process through a soft consensus based around a Discord poll followed by a confirmatory governance vote will take place on the last 2 weeks of each quarter, if successful, the recruit NFT will be burnt and a new SuperUMAn NFT will be minted and issued.

## Becoming Core SuperUMAn
A Core SuperUMAn is not officially part of the membership of the DAO as becoming a Core SuperUMAn doesn’t change their voting weight. Their voting weight is the same as a SuperUMAn. Core SuperUMAn are seen as consistent contributing members of the DAO which have a large enough impact to receive higher compensation compared to a SuperUMAn.

There will be a promotions process through a soft consensus based around a Discord poll followed by a confirmatory governance vote that will take place in the last 2 weeks of each quarter. This process is further defined under Mechanism for Confirming Membership Tier changes.

## Becoming UMAster
UMAsters are the critical elements of the DAO’s functioning and take on specific responsibilities for an area of work, either taking on a specific role or function or generally providing DAO leadership. It is expected that team leads would be UMAsters.

UMAsters should comprise no more than 20% of the membership of the DAO. The definition of an UMAster is somewhat subjective and it is recognised that members may value different qualities in different members based around their commitment and responsibility.

The promotions process will occur through a soft consensus based around a Discord poll followed by a confirmatory governance vote that will take place every six weeks with an indication of the number of vacancies available. Once the UMAsters are identified, their SuperUMAn NFT will be burnt and a new UMAster NFT will be minted and issued.

UMAsters will be re-elected every quarter.


## Exiting the DAO
A member should be free to exit the DAO at any time and can do so by sending their NFT to a designated burn address, or request removal by the superUMAn.eth registrar. 

If there is substantial misalignment between the member and the mission, values and goals of the DAO, an active off-boarding process will be activated. This will be managed by the Community Management team within the Operations Team, who will deal with initial infractions dealt with on an informal case by case basis, prior to a formal process being invoked, this may involve limiting communications actions. The forcible removal of a member will be a matter of DAO governance.


## Redesignation of Role
Should the DAO decide that any particular member no longer meets the criterion for membership at their tier level, but are still in line with the DAO’s mission, there should be a time bound process led by the community management team to explore whether it is appropriate for that member to be moved to another team, or retrained or to retain that tier. 

A SuperUMAn may be reduced a tier, with a demotion to Alumni may be in order with the community management team suggesting candidates to be moved from SuperUMAn to Alumni on a per epoch basis, to be proposed via a Discord poll and confirmed through governance where upon their SuperUMAn NFT will be burnt and an Alumni NFT issued.

## Reactivating SuperUMAn Status
A simple process which would demonstrate that an Alumni has again become active and would be eligible for SuperUMAn status involving a similar process to becoming a SuperUMAn with a discord poll to achieve soft consensus of re-activation, confirmed through governance.

## UMAster Role Redesignation
In the event an existing UMAster does not get reelected during an UMAster election they will be redesignated to Core SuperUMAn which is solely a compensation level. Their UMAster NFT will be burned and replaced with a SuperUMAn NFT.
