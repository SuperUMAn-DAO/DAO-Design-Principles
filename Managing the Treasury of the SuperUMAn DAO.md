## Managing the Treasury of the SuperUMAn DAO

## Preamble
Overview and accounting of funds in the DAO treasury will be the responsibility of the treasury team, as well as dispersal of emergency funds. Compensation and funding should focus on optimistic evaluation and consideration while being responsible and dutiful in supporting the DAO and its mission.

## Treasury Governance
The main funds of the treasury will be held in a smart contract and dispersed via an on-chain mechanism using SafeSnap with added security provided by UMA’s Optimistic Oracle, when available. If a governance proposal to allocate funds is passed, the funds will be automatically distributed to the identified source as part of the governance procedure.

## Funding Allocation for Teams
It is recognised that the teams which comprise the SuperUMAn DAO may have general ongoing costs. Teams should submit requests for funding with a detailed budget each quarter, a minimum of three weeks before the end of epoch. These requests would be aggregated together and then put forward as a governance proposal.

It would be expected that each team budget request should not exceed a value of greater than $2500 (excluding any team based compensation). Funds in excess of this value should be considered a bounty or grant project and would require a dedicated governance proposal for the funds to be released. Team funds will be managed through a multi-sig composed of members of that team in a 2 of 3 structure.

## Emergency Funds
Additionally there should be a “petty cash” wallet controlled by the Treasury team through a 2 of 3 multisig, initially funded to the value of $25k that can be used as an emergency budget. This will be replenished through the governance process. Requests from DAO members to the emergency fund should only be made for activities which can demonstrate a critical need which is time-sensitive, which will then be evaluated by the Treasury team. Should the request be granted, a retrospective should be conducted to ensure emergency requests are minimised.

## Compensation to Contributors
It would be expected that the  compensation of members of the SuperUMAn DAO should be centrally allocated from the treasury. While the precise allocation and mechanism for this compensation will be the subject of a governance proposal, it is suggested that such an allocation should adhere to some basic principles:

- There should be a stablecoin allocation for members of the DAO who are SuperUMAns or UMAsters
- Quarterly KPI options should be available for all DAO members
- There should be a level of compensation allocated to teams for team based compensation including peer evaluation and tipping.

## Establishment of Grants and Bounties
Where there is an identified piece of work that is not a core part of the DAO’s activity, or a particular development that requires funding, a grant proposal may be submitted. Similarly, bounty programmes for contributors may also be established where a proposal is passed through governance in advance. The grants and bounty proposals may be denominated in different currencies.

## Revenue Generation
We should pursue a revenue generation strategy that is based on a multi-chain approach, but with the appropriate security safeguards. The SuperUMAn DAO aims not only to offer value to UMA, but to offer value to other DAOs by making UMA products available, accessible and easy to use in addition to providing other expertise from the SuperUMAn DAO, in order for them to meet their goals. Methods by which these DAOs can compensate the SuperUMAn DAO for that value should be explored.

Funding requests to UMA though an UMIP should be submitted by the Treasury team with a soft consensus obtained through a Discord poll from the SuperUMAn DAO. UMA has indicated a willingness to consider additional funding to be allocated to the DAO through UMIPs submitted though the UMA governance process. The SuperUMAn DAO is heavily aligned with the UMA protocol and wishes to continue to provide value to the protocol in exchange for the resources necessary to make that happen.

It is also acknowledged that the bulk of the SuperUMAn treasury will be held, at least initially, in UMA tokens. The DAO intends to vote within the DVM to secure UMA’s oracle and receive inflationary rewards in exchange. This opportunity should be maximised through the combined efforts of the Governance and Treasury teams.

## Treasury Diversification
Technical management of the treasury includes diversification, hence there is a need to hold ETHEREUM and MATIC for transactions on Ethereum mainnet and Polygon, particularly to cover DVM voting gas expenses.  If compensation is to be paid in stablecoins, the treasury should hold appropriate quantities to meet its immediate obligations.
