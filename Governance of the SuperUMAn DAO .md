## Governance of the SuperUMAn DAO 

## Preamble
Topics that require broad consensus for the DAO itself or require the use of our resources should go through governance, including requests for the treasury to unlock tranches of funds.  Strategy management decisions and membership management would also be confirmed by governance.


## Who has Governance Power
Members of the DAO belong to one of three tiers - Basic, SuperUMAn and UMAster. These tiers are indicated by NFTs belonging to DAO members and provided either at the founding of the DAO or when a new member is recruited.

These tiers of memberships confer differential voting rights. 

The tiers are 
- Basic (Recruits + Honorary DAOplomats + Alumni)
	baseline: one member, 1 vote
- SuperUMAn
	enhanced: one member, 10 votes
- UMAster
	enhanced plus: one member, 20 votes


## Details of Governance Mechanism
The governance mechanism consists of 2 tracks:
- 1. Normal Track / Regular Governance for all proposals submitted, and;
- 2. Fast Track / Expedited Governance for eligible proposals that are of significant importance and under circumstances considered urgent to be ratified quickly.

## Normal Track / Regular Governance
The governance mechanism is comprised of a four step process, involving Discord, Discourse and Snapshot. These will be linked together with Discord providing access to Discourse governance forums to identify the membership tiers which will be reflected in Discord roles in order that the members meeting the quorum requirement can be identified. The minimum amount of time it would take for a proposal to be passed is 8 days.

**Stage 1 - Optional tempcheck**

There will be a recommended temp check on Discord, general support, feedback suggestions, collaboration on proposal.

**Stage 2 - Compulsory Signal** 

A rough proposal will be posted on Discourse, to gather feedback including likes. If the post receives 5 likes, it can then pass to the formal proposal stage. If the proposal has not received 5 likes after 7 days then the topic will be closed. Anyone can make a proposal. Proposals will be announced on a Discord announcements channel. 

**Stage 3 - Formal Proposal and poll**

A formal proposal on Discourse can be submitted once the rough proposal in the above stage has received 5 likes. The proposal may be slightly altered, however it should be transparently in the same spirit. This proposal will include a poll with three elements
 - Yes
 - More Discussion
 - No
In order for a proposal to pass to a Snapshot vote a simple majority (51% of votes cast) is required for Yes. In order for this vote to be valid there is a quorum of 10% SuperUMAns and 3 UMAsters, with the poll running for 5-7 days. Formal proposals will be announced on a Discord announcements channel 

**Stage 4 - Snapshot vote**

If there is more than 51% for yes in the poll in the stage above, the proposal then moves to a  Snapshot vote, comprised of a crisp summary of the proposal with link(s) to discussion on Discourse.  This Snapshot vote requires a 51% majority and a quorum of 50% of the total voting power of the DAO. The snapshot will be open for 3-7 days.

## Fast Track / Expedited Governance
Under this track, proposals can be brought forward (expedited) for quicker deliberation, voting, and ratification, with an expected minimum time of 4 days from start to finish. Like Regular Governance, the platforms for governance (Discord, Discourse and Snapshot) will not change, but some stages can be omitted but with a higher criteria for quorum and passing vote.

**Exclusions**

Proposals which modify the following:
- a. Proposals for membership status changes;
- b. Proposals for compensation level changes.

These are not eligible for expedited governance.

**Stage 1 - Declaration**

The Optional Temp Check is omitted in this track. However, the author must declare in the beginning of the proposal that they intend to submit their proposal under the Expedited Governance track.

**Stage 2 - Signal**

This stage is omitted under Expedited Governance.

**Stage 3 - Formal Proposal**

A formal proposal shall be submitted on Discourse with a poll consisting of the following:
  - Yes (or various proposed Options)
  - More discussions needed
  - No

There must be a minimum endorsement from 5 UMAsters, and;

The quorum of the proposal is raised to 50%, and is limited to active UMAsters and SuperUMAns only, and;

The passing vote needs to be a supermajority (67% or above).

The poll run length is reduced to 48 hours.

In the event that at the end of the poll run time the quorum, endorsement or passing vote requirements are not met, the proposal is considered Failed (see ‘Failed Proposals under Expedited Governance’).

**Stage 4 - Snapshot Proposal**
a. Provided that the criteria for passing Stage 3 of the proposal is met, then the proposal shall be posted on Snapshot following the same formatting guidelines as Regular Governance with the additional criteria:

b. The quorum for the Snapshot vote (Stage 4) is 70% of total voting power of the entire DAO;

c. The threshold for a passing vote is 80%.

d. The Snapshot run length is reduced to 48 hours.

e. In the event that at the end of the poll run time the quorum or passing vote requirements are not met, the proposal is considered Failed (see ‘Failed Proposals under Expedited Governance’).

**Failed Proposals under Expedited Governance**

If the proposal has Failed at any stage, the proposal is not eligible to be resubmitted under the Expedited Governance track.

## Utilising Treasury Assets to Vote in Governance or DVM Votes

**Stage 1 - Proposal** 

A proposal on how to vote on the DVM or another governance proposal is made in a dedicated channel in the SuperUMAn Discord

**Stage 2a - Proposal is not Disputed**

If the proposed vote is not disputed within 2 hours, the proposal is passed directly to a snapshot poll with a voting window of 4 hours.  

**Stage 2b - Proposal is Disputed** 

If the proposed vote is disputed within the 2 hour window a discord poll is run with a window of 2 hours. If the proposed vote is confirmed, the proposal is passed to Snapshot with a voting window of 4 hours. If the Discord poll does not confirm the proposal, another proposal may be made as per Stage 1.

**Stage 3 - Snapshot Poll**

A simple majority is required to trigger the on-chain voting proposal. In the case of UMA DVM votes this will trigger both the commit vote, and the reveal vote 24 hours later.

## Mechanism for Confirming Membership Tier changes
- 1. Nominations for UMAsters open for 5 days and will be indicated by nomination or a self-nomination process through emoji, where if the number of nominations exceeds the number of spaces, a Discord poll for UMAsters will be conducted indicating the number of vacancies. If a Core SuperUMAn or UMAster is nominated by someone else then they need to accept the nomination by replying to the nomination & adding their emoji reaction, to be considered for the role. Nominees may only consist of current UMAsters and Core SuperUMAns. Only SuperUMAn tier and above may vote in the election. Those who receive the highest votes receive the UMAster places. In the event of a tie, a second poll will be run between the tied members.
 
- 2. Starting alongside UMAster nominations, the nominations for Core SuperUMAns open for 5 days and will be indicated by a self-nomination process through emoji. The Operations team has a buffer of up to 1 day afterwards to collect a testimonial from 1 UMAster and 1 other SuperUMAn for approval of each self-nomination. A 24 hour emoji based poll for each SuperUMAn promotion to Core SuperUMAn, is organized by Operations Team by combining the two testimonials. A minimum of 8 emoji responses, 5 from UMAsters and 3 from SuperUMAns, is required in order for the SuperUMAn to be added to the proposal as a Core SuperUMAn.
 
- 3. The Operations Teams will collate nominations from teams in conjunction with the Onboarding Team for Recruits who are being recommended to be promoted to SuperUMAns. Emoji based poll for Recruits promotion to SuperUMAns, organised by Operations Team which includes a short testimonial for each nominated recruit. A minimum of 5 emoji responses from UMAsters and SuperUMAns is required in order for the Recruit to be added to the proposal.

- 4. The Operations Teams will collate nominations from teams of SuperUMAns who are being recommended to be moved to Alumni. The Operations team will organise an emoji based poll for SuperUMAns to Alumni, with min of 5 emojis to exclude from the proposal.
 
- 5. Operations team collates the tier changes at the six week point and write the Snapshot, with a simple majority and no quorum and a window of 24 hours.


## Implementation of Governance Decisions
SafeSnap will be used to implement the onchain proposal managed by the Governance team.
